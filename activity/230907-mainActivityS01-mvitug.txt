Hi, My name is Maria Cassandra Vitug
As a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I've been actively engaged in both my academic journey and practical experiences to build a well-rounded skill set. 
My latest school experience has been a culmination of rigorous coursework which has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms. 
I've also been working part-time as a Game Marshal at Acad Arena, where I've gained valuable insights into the world of esports tournaments, honing my teamwork, communication, and organizational skills.
Recently, I completed a rewarding internship with Etihad, where I delved into real-world applications of my computer science and data analytics knowledge.
I am now eagerly seeking more opportunities to further enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects in the field.
I am into gaming with my friends online, I currently play Valorant and League of Legends during my free time.
Sometimes when I'm feeling artsy I paint or draw digital artwork using my Huion digital drawing pad.
I love travelling and have been to a lot of countries like Hongkong, UAE, China etc...
Regularly hanging out with friends outside is also one of my great hobbies, while I take care of my academics I make sure to have a great social life too.
Lastly, my favorite movie is Disney's Tangled because of its great story and vibrant art.
